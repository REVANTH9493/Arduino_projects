### **Basic Arduino Projects**  

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform used for building interactive projects. Here are some simple **basic Arduino projects** for beginners:  

1. **LED Blinking** – The "Hello World" of Arduino, where an LED blinks at a fixed interval.  
2. **Traffic Light System** – Simulates a real-world traffic signal using LEDs and a timer.  
3. **Temperature and Humidity Monitor** – Uses a DHT11 sensor to measure and display temperature and humidity.  
4. **Motion Detector** – Uses a PIR sensor to detect movement and trigger an alarm or LED.  
5. **Obstacle Avoiding Robot** – Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and navigate accordingly.  
6. **Automatic Fan Control** – Uses a temperature sensor to turn a fan on/off based on temperature.  
7. **Smart Door Lock** – Uses a keypad and servo motor to control door access.  
8. **Gas Leak Detector** – Uses an MQ-2 gas sensor to detect gas leaks and trigger an alarm.  

These projects help beginners understand Arduino programming, sensor integration, and automation concepts.
